# Creating a Website on S3

## Lab Overview

In this lab, you will gain hands-on experience with the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) by performing several tasks from an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance. The activities include:

1. **Creating an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket**: You will create a bucket in S3, which will serve as the storage location for the website files.

2. **Creating a new AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user**: This user will have full access to the Amazon S3 service, allowing you to manage the bucket and its contents securely.

3. **Uploading files to Amazon S3**: Upload the necessary files to your S3 bucket to host a simple website for the Caf√© & Bakery.

4. **Creating a batch file**: This file will be used to update the static website whenever you change any of the website files locally. It automates the process of pushing updates to the S3 bucket, ensuring that the latest version of your website is always available to visitors.

This lab provides a practical application of AWS services to deploy and manage a static website hosted on Amazon S3.
